# Description

The SMS Ham-Spam detection dataset is a set of SMS tagged messages that have been collected for SMS Spam research. It contains a set of 5,574 SMS messages in English, considering both train and test data. The tagging standard was defined as `ham` (legitimate) or `spam`. 

The `train` and `test` files are formatted using the standard of one message per line. Each line is composed by two columns: one with label (`ham` or `spam`) and other with the raw text. Here are some examples:

```
ham   What you doing?how are you?
ham   Ok lar... Joking wif u oni...
ham   dun say so early hor... U c already then say...

    Note: messages are not chronologically sorted.

For evaluation purposes, the `test` dataset does not prosent the categories (`ham`, `spam`). Therefore, the `train` data is the full source of information for this test.

# Objective

The goal of the this test is to achieve a model that can correctly manage the incoming messages on SMS format (`ham` or `spam`). Considering a real scenario, assume that a regular person does not want to see a `spam` message. However, they accepts if a normal message (`ham`) is sometimes allocated at the `spam` box.

# Important details

- The dataset was split in order to have unseen data for analysis. We took 15% of the total data (randomly)
- Replicate the data format for submission, i.e. the answer must be provided as a CSV file with the detect class in the first column and the text in the second column, similarly to what is provided in the `TrainingSet` file
- The `TestSet` will be used for evalution, therefore the candidate must provide the first column with the predicted classes (`ham` or `spam`)
- Pay attention to the real case scenario that was described in the Objective section. This may drive the problem solving strategy :wink:.
- This test does not require a defined set of algorithms to be used. The candidate is free to choose any kind of data processing pipeline to reach the best answer.
