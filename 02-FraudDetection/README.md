# Fraud Detection

## Description

Unfortunately the solution to this challenge has not been implemented, but I leave here the development until the present time :(

For this solution, 30% of the images of the 3 categories (disguise, genuine and simulated) were stipulated to compose the training data.

A CNN was used, but the validation loss of the network always converged to a fixed point of 0.4851. This problem tried to be corrected in several ways but without success.

Perhaps, due to the limited number of images used, even with data argumentation, it did not give the network enough features for the model to progress.

Another strategy that could be used is the use of transfer lerning from a more complex CNN network.

The [data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hAyIlI8NjvG8dkm8hmAe3URf2v9Tlfz-/view?usp=sharing]) available for training the network are available in the original readme for the challenge.
